    # it seems silly to assign pronouns to this mere machine
    # but think how much you interact with them
    # don't they resemble somewhat of a person
    # with their error codes, error messages and delightful successes
    # they're somewhat of a gateway to another world
    # how would i meet the person mentioned below
    # with this marvel of engineering
    # but also that comes at a cost
    # it is *privilege* to use this machine currently
    # think of the rest of the earth with no access to it
    # or very limited one at best
    # it is not only a tool of entertainment
    # but also of a new age of bypassing governments
    # where in 1878 a newspaper could get simply closed down
    #
    # as an example 
    # the co-operative restaurant founded
    # partially by Eugene Varlin was closed in 1871
    # due to governmental repression 
    # following the fall of the Paris Commune
    # (Mr. Varlin himself was shot on the 28th of May)
    #
    # the liberty of the world depends on those devices
    # being free from corporate and government reach
